## Overview

### The challenge

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

### Links
- Live Site URL: [https://sahradordete.github.io/sunnyside/]

## My process
I tried to build my HTML before jumping into CSS. After finishing the structure of the page in HTML I started my CSS styling and work section after section trying to keep as close to the given design as possible. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I feel that I learned a lot from this project, even though I had to develop in a short period of time. I can already see some areas I might be improving in future projects.
Taking this challange helped me to understand a bit more about CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout and get a sense of how the properties work with parent and child containers.


### Continued development

For a future project would be interesting to learn more about the behaviour of pseudo elements and these working within different screen sizes. 
Another aspect of develop a project that would make things easier would be structuring a better HTML before jumping into CSS.


### Useful resources
